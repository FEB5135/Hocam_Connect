# Hocam Connect by ACM

METU NCC Super APP!

## Getting Started

The Hocam Connect Mobile Application is designed to serve as an all-in-one
solution for the everyday needs of METU NCC students. 
 
The app will consolidate functionalities from the NCClife website, such as dining hall menus,
transportation options, and GPA calculators, while also introducing new fea
tures like a second-hand marketplace and semester-course organizing tools.
 
The goal is to enhance student life by providing a centralized platform for
essential campus services and social needs.
